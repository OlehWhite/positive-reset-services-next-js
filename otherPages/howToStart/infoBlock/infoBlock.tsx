                If you’re thinking of starting a franchise, you’re probably
                thinking of becoming a franchisee. That is, you want to become a
                business owner by franchising under a community.

              <Text>
                As you probably know, a franchise is a business model and a
                brand—and when you become a franchisee or franchise owner,
                you’re signing a franchise contract and putting down some money
                for the right to use that business model, sistem and brand.

              <Text>
                Franchise brands are everywhere. If you have a favorite business
                joint that you know to in cities around the country, that’s
                almost certainly a franchise. In other words, instead of being
                owned by a corporation, individuals own and operate one or two
                or several of those business.

              <Title>SOME BENEFITS OF FRANCHISE BUSINESS MODELS</Title>
              <Text>
                One of the biggest benefits of buying into a franchise is that
                it&apos;s an stable анд verified business. It already has an
                patients and clients, and someone has worked out a lot of the
                kinks in the process — in short, you don&apos;t have to reinvent
                the wheel. New owners in a franchise have distinct advantages
                over new owners of small businesses.
