                Mental health treatments have become patient-clinic. Evaluating
                recovery in people with mental health difficulties living in the
                community can help to develop better patient-clinic services.
                Community integration is critical to recovery in patients with
                mental health difficulties.

                Participating in mental health clinic programs promoted mental
                health recovery in people with mental health difficulties living
                in the community. Independence/self-actualization, psychological
                integration and social support improved mental health recovery
                in people with mental health difficulties living in the
                community.

                There is a need to develop and actively promote programs that
                attract people with mental health difficulties living in the
                community so that they will actively use mental health clinic
                services. Offering systematic social skills training and
                occupational rehabilitation therapy to people with mental health
                difficulties living in the community may help them function
                independently.
