              economic environment.

              Positive Reset Services is a behavioral care franchise that has
              developed a telemedicine system that transforms and simplifies
              mental health services. Our network of physicians supporting this
              unique Behavioral Care model is at the center of its success. The
              presence of doctors every hour when the clinic is open allows
              patients to receive services. This is a great competitive
              advantage given that by normal industry standards, it takes a long
              time to see a doctor. This is a new and secure business model that
              allows clinics to operate, franchisees to run their business, hire
              employees and take care of patients.

            All franchisees have access to a proprietary telemedicine software
            system. Telemedicine immediately resonated with existing and
            potential franchisees, which they proclaim as an innovative business
            model that will be attractive to future investors trying to see what
            business opportunities will be viable in our current economic
            climate.

            This allows an investor with no experience in the behavioral field
            to scale their business in the industry. If you combine the fact
            that mental health care is recession resistant with our advanced
            telemedicine software, you have a recipe for success with or without
            a pandemic, of course.

              Thanks to telehealth and the need for mental health services,
              franchisees can depend on a successful business model that
              performs well during even the most challenging economic
              circumstances. The path to success is very straightforward to
              understand. Not only is it a business model that’s going to work
              for a year or two, it’s a concept that you can easily see working
              for the length of the franchise agreement.
