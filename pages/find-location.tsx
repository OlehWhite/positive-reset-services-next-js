                For Mental Health franchises, the right location is key to
                success. The catch is that franchisor willingness to help find
                the site and negotiate the lease varies tremendously. When
                you’re on the lookout for the perfect location for your shiny
                new franchise, here are three key considerations.

                Although your franchise agreement might include the rights to a
                particular geographic region, there are often umpteen potential
                sites. It’s important to identify the best environment for your
                fledgling business to succeed. That analysis requires an
                experienced franchisor with a team that has studied the best
                environments for the franchise’s success, and that works with
                experienced real estate brokers or a commercial broker network.
                Positive Reset Services has such experience and connections. We
                will always support you in finding a location for your clinic.

                A suitable building is one part of the equation, but it’s
                equally important to understand the area, including traffic
                patterns, demographics and future building plans. Even if a
                location looks great on paper, it’s important to inspect the
                traffic patterns around it. If it’s too difficult to access,
                patients might not bother.

                Positive Reset Services strongly recommends all franchisees
                retain legal counsel to review their leases to protect their
                best interests and ensure the lease allows for fulfillment of
                the franchise agreements, including space configuration, signage
                and other factors.
