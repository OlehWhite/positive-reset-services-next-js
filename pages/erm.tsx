                They are essentially an electronic form of paper charts. With
                effective workflows you can see more patients in less time,
                reducing the time it takes for new patients to get an
                appointment and improving your ability to provide follow-up
                care. Clients are also less likely to need emergency
                mental-health-related treatment when they can access servises.

                EMR COMPLETE is a practice management system for mental health
                clinic providers. It helps automate functions such as scheduling
                recurring appointments, creating and sending invoices against
                patient care, and generating reports to assess practice
                performance and make data-driven decisions.

                EMR COMPLETE offers video consultations to reduce the
                administrative burden of onboarding patients. It also records
                each session. For practitioners that handle prescriptions, the
                software maintains a record of patient dosages and medication
                types.
