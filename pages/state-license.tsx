                The franchise has, hopefully, already done the work of building
                a brand and patients trust. That means you’re more likely to
                have customers as soon as you open, and you can even leverage on
                existing knowledge of the brand to build excitement for the
                opening beforehand. Your business is backed by the overall
                franchise, which means you have more leeway for growing pains
                than you might with a stand-alone small business.
