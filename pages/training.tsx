                Entrusting franchise owners to represent a brand is a
                significant risk. Most franchises provide training programs to
                ensure all those representing the brand are aligned with the
                franchisor. Franchisees attend an initial training program and
                often have ongoing training to keep everyone on the same page.
                This guidance also keeps the team abreast of changes as the
                system evolves.

              <Text>
                One of the most important reasons franchises offer training
                programs is to achieve brand consistency so every customer has
                the same experience no matter which location they enter. The
                franchise has to educate and instruct its owners on how to
                duplicate the original.

              <Text>
                Why do Franchisors Provide Training Programs? The goals of any
                great franchise system are to achieve consistent, sustainable
                replication of their brand promise to consumers, and for the
                franchise system to be financially successful at every level.
                Training is a major component of achieving that goal.
