                Our Medication Management Program is staffed by healthcare
                professionals that provide evaluation, diagnosis and medication
                intervention in the treatment of mental health disorders.
                Individuals receiving medication are monitored for progress,
                ongoing evaluation of symptoms and quality of life improvement.

                Our mental well-being is directly connected with our overall
                physical health. Experiences like stress or trauma can leave us
                anxious, overwhelmed and hopeless. Untreated, these feelings can
                lead to major psychological and physical illnesses or to
                behaviors that can become addictive and destructive. Our Clinic
                approaches mental health and substance use treatment through a
                multidisciplinary program that focuses on the whole person —
                physical, spiritual, psychological and social.
