              One of the biggest factors in determining the revenue of a mental
              health clinic is the number of patients they can see. Using your
              rooms efficiently is important in order to allow your staff to see
              patients in a timely manner. For practices struggling with space
              issues, one of the best ways to optimize space and increase
              efficiency may this: assign small groups of rooms to specialists
              and support staff.

              With the help of a space management tool, start by creating a
              floor plan of your current layout and resources. The next step is
              to decide how you would like to change the overall layout of your
              office—meaning the big picture changes you’d like to make to
              change company culture and productivity. You may consider an open
              office plan to encourage visibility and collaboration, or you
              might want cubicles to ensure privacy and concentration.

              Keep in mind that wayfinding plays a key role in your employees’
              productivity, and ensure that the design you pick will encourage
              the appropriate amount of interaction between employees.
              Experiment with different layout options to determine the best
              balance between an aesthetic design and the needs of your
              business.

              Before committing to any office lease, make sure the location is
              serviceable by a high-speed internet provider. Research which
              internet service provider (ISP) can connect your office well
              before you move in. Then, once you’ve found a few providers,
              compare their plans, prices, and contracts. Also, remember that
              commercial accounts often differ from residential ones, so be
              careful when looking at their terms.
