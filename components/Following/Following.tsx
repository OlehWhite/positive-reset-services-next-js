              Before jumping into role-specific interview questions, it can be

              After asking about the candidate’s career goals, transition to
              role-specific questions. Consider coming up with a list of
              interview questions ahead of time. If you’re interviewing multiple
              candidates, it may also be helpful to come up with a way to score
              each interviewee. For example, you might grade them on their
              confidence and poise when answering questions, their ability to
              answer clearly and concisely and whether they addressed each part
              of a multiple part question.

              Gather additional information about a candidate’s experience by
              asking follow-up questions. Asking a candidate to expand on their
              answers can give you greater insight into their thought processes,
              personality, values and experience. Always be ready to ask a
              follow-up question and use your list of pre-written interview
              questions as a guide, rather than a strict plan.

              To help you make more confident and informed hiring decisions,
              take notes during the interview so you can remember more details
              later on. For example, you can jot down your first impressions of
              the candidates, take note of their body language. However, be
              careful to maintain the right balance between note-taking and
              active listening. Ensure that you’re making eye contact and fully
              engaging in the conversation, only pausing to take down notes
              every once in a while.

              fair interview process can help you decide how well a candidate’s
              skills, experience and personality align with company needs and
              avoid costly hiring mistakes.
