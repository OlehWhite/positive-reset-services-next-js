              The operations manual is the rule book if you will for a franchise
              system. It contains all the aspects of the business the owners
              need to learn to operate the franchise. Like a school syllabus
              outlines a course, the manual serves a similar purpose. Every
              business has its unique styles, including dialect, recipes,
              uniforms, how to greet customers, etc. Traditionally, the
              operations manual includes the franchise goals, daily procedures,
              accounting, customer service, personnel topics and training
              employees. The information included in the manual is confidential.
              Often, franchisees are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement
              before beginning this phase. The franchisor also outlines specific
              performance expectations and instructions on how to provide sales
              reports, etc.

              After the operations manual training, franchisees are taken to
              corporate headquarters for hands-on training. In this stage, new
              franchise owners tour the facility and witness the experts in
              action. During this tour, is a perfect opportunity for franchisees
              to ask questions and test what they have learned. Itâ€™s also a time
              to see how to operate the machinery and/or make recipes for the
              first time.

            <TypographyText paragraph>
              Training at headquarters can last a few days to one week. This is
              the time franchise owners need to grasp each concept to operate
              their business. In many cases, franchise owners are encouraged to
              bring along a manager or employee who will train other staff
              members on-site.

              This type of training is carried out at the new franchise
              location. The franchisee must be familiar with the machinery,
              recipes, customer service training as well as knowledge on all
              business procedures. On-site, the franchisee, is one step from
              being an expert. When they get to this phase, they hire and train
              staff for specific roles such as cashiers, customer service, and
              office positions. Often times, a franchise mentor from the
              corporate office is assigned to new franchisees. This
              representative can assist with the grand opening of the new
              franchise.

              At this point, the new franchisee is up to speed in carrying out
              the daily operations of the business. A few functions may still
              need attention to work out the kinks, but the bulk of what was
              included in the manual is mastered. Franchise teams provide
              ongoing training through field training programs, webinars,
              on-site visits, and conferences. Continuous training is essential
              to keeping franchisees informed about insider tips, new products
              or services, and future advertising and marketing campaigns.
