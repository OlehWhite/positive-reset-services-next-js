              Each day our mission is to enable people to realize their dreams.
              We do this with each new franchisee we add to our family. For some
              of them that dream may be tied to a financial goal.

              For others it’s the independence of business ownership, and in
              some cases, it may be as simple as creating job opportunities for
              friends and family; but through keeping this mission top of mind
              each day, we remain inspired in the work that we do. We use modern
              marketing, sales tools, and strategies to find outstanding
              candidates and help them become franchisees.

              What is the main goal of franchising business? It sells the right
              to use its name and idea. The franchisee buys this right to sell
              the franchisor’s services under an existing business model and
              trademark. Franchises are a popular way for entrepreneurs to start
              a business, especially when entering a highly competitive industry
              such as behavioral care. It is also the goal of the franchise
              company that franchisors are more successful and financially
              independent. The more successful the franchise company, the more
              benefits the franchisee receives.
